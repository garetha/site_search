# SiteSearch

This gem provides a simple and extremely flexible way to include site-wide searching in Rack based web applications, such as Ruby on Rails.

## Installation

Install the latest stable release:

	[sudo] gem install site_search

In Rails, add it to your Gemfile:

``` ruby
gem 'site_search'
```

## Getting Started

Start off by generating the required config and initializer files:

    Rails 3

	    rails g site_search:google_custom_search

	Rails 2.3

	    script/generate google_custom_search

this should give you files in:

	config/initializers/load_site_search_config.rb
	config/google_custom_search.yml

## Configuring SiteSearch

SiteSearch currently only supports Google Custom Search and allows for multiple search engines to be configured and utilized.

Edit the google_custom_search.yml file in config/

``` yaml
production:
  api_key: "YOUR-API-KEY"
  search_engines:
    your_search_engine:
        cx: "YOUR-CX-RECORD"
```

An initializer file is required to load the config settings, if you're using Rails, one is created for you:

## Using SiteSearch

In your controller create an instance of the GoogleSearch class by passing the name of the search engine and the search arguments:

``` ruby
@search = SiteSearch::GoogleSearch.new(:your_search_engine, params[:query_string])
```

You can then access the results in the view like so:

``` ruby
<% @search.results.each do |result| %>
    <%= result.title %>
    <%= result.text %>
    <%= result.url %>
<% end %>
```

You can also access the raw document that is received from the Google Custom Search API.

``` ruby
@search.raw
```

The GoogleSearch class also accepts optional query parameters(check out the [Google Custom Search API](http://code.google.com/apis/customsearch/v1/using_rest.html#query-params) for details), for example the alt parameter for specifying the format
of the response, can either be json(default) or atom.

``` ruby
@search = SiteSearch::GoogleSearch.new(:your_search_engine, params[:query_string], {:alt=>'atom'})
```
